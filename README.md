# ModelarDB
ModelarDB is a modular model-based time series management system that interfaces
a query engine and a storage system with ModelarDB Core. This Core is a
self-contained, adaptive and highly extensible Java library for automatic online
compression of time series. ModelarDB is designed for Unix-like operating
systems and tested on Linux and macOS.

We are always happy to hear from anybody who tries ModelarDB. From experience
reports we get a better understanding of the system's current limitations and
how to continue improving it. For any comment or requests regarding ModelarDB
please use GitHub issues so the discussion is kept public. For discussions that
cannot be public, you can, however, send us a private
[email](mailto:skj@cs.aau.dk "email").

## Installation
1. Install the Scala Build Tool *sbt*.
2. Clone the ModelarDB Git repository https://github.com/skejserjensen/ModelarDB
3. Start *sbt* in the root of the repository and run one of the following commands:

- **compile** compiles ModelarDB to Java class files.
- **package** compiles ModelarDB to a Jar file.
- **assembly** compiles ModelarDB to an uber Jar file.*
- **run** executes ModelarDB's main method.

\* To execute ModelarDB on an existing Apache Spark cluster, an uber jar must
be created; use [sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) to ensure
the necessary dependencies are included as part of this archive.

## Configuration
ModelarDB requires that a configuration file is available at
*$HOME/Programs/modelardb.conf* or as the first command-line argument. This file
must specify the query processing engine and storage system to use. An example
configuration is included as part of this repository.
